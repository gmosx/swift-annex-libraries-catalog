# Swift Annex Libraries Catalog

A curated catalog of best-of-breed, cross-platform Swift libraries that follow the
[Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
and play well together.

This project is similar in spirit to [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/contents.html),
[Boost C++ Libraries](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/), etc.

## Libraries

* [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio)
* [Swift Protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf)
* [Numeric Annex](https://github.com/xwu/NumericAnnex)
* [Collections](https://github.com/reizu/swift-collections)
* [Statistics](https://github.com/reizu/swift-statistcs)
* [Color](https://github.com/reizu/swift-color)

## Criteria for inclusion

* Strict adherence to the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
* Compatibility with Apple platforms (iOS, MacOS, etc) and Linux
* No duplication of functionality (one library per domain)

## FAQ

### Why is it named `Swift Annex`?

These libraries form an independent body of functionality that can be attached to the standard library of Swift, similar to how an 'annex' is attached to a legal document.

## Community

Pull-requests with additional libraries that satisfy the above criteria are
_especially_ welcome.
